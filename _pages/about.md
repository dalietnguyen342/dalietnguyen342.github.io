Welcome to my homepage! I'm **Nguyen Ngoc Yen Nhi**. Currently, I work as a **Biostatistician / Data Science Intern** at [Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU)](https://www.oucru.org/) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where I apply advanced statistical techniques and machine learning methods to biomedical research. I am also an active research team member at **DS@UIT Club**, where I contribute to innovative projects in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am pursuing my **Bachelor of Science in Data Science** at the **University of Information Technology (UIT)**, Vietnam, consistently achieving academic excellence as evidenced by my Dean’s List recognitions and EVN Scholarship award.
