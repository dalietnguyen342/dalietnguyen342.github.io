In this project, we collected and standardized statistical data from 2002 to 2022 covering multiple indicators—including healthcare, social security, economy, labor, employment, and average income per capita—for all 63 provinces in Vietnam. The dataset was sourced directly from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam, which permits the use of its published data provided proper citation.

Using regression and clustering algorithms, we designed custom indices to rank the livability of each province and predict the Human Development Index. Data visualization and analysis were performed using Python libraries such as <b>Pandas, Numpy, Tableau, and Seaborn</b>.
