Preprocessing involves eliminating noise and redundant information that may reduce model performance, thereby allowing the model to focus on key features. In this project, our research group analyzed the effectiveness of various preprocessing techniques in the context of diabetic retinopathy detection—a major cause of visual impairment and blindness among diabetic patients.

We implemented two preprocessing methods and applied them across six different models, ranging from traditional machine learning algorithms to advanced deep learning frameworks, using two distinct datasets. To rigorously assess the impact, we placed strong emphasis on statistical evaluation. Our analysis involved one-way and two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, to identify significant differences among the preprocessing techniques.

The statistical analysis revealed that most preprocessing methods resulted in only minimal improvements in performance, and deep learning models appeared to be less sensitive to these techniques compared to traditional machine learning methods. This work underscores the necessity of statistically validating preprocessing strategies to ensure that only those methods that truly enhance diagnostic accuracy are applied.
