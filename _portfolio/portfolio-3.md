Description: Developed a real-time multi-object tracking system for UAV videos addressing aerial video challenges using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for scalable data processing, combined with deep learning models (YOLOv8/YOLOv10, ByteTrack). Achieved HOTA 48.14 and MOTA 43.51 on Visdrone2019, maintaining 28 FPS on a single GPU.
